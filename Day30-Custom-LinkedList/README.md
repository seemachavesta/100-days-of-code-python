# Linked List Implementation in Python

This project is part of my **100 Days of Code in Python** challenge (Day 30)  
and also a step in my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

## Features
- Insert at the **beginning**, **end**, or **specific index**
- Retrieve values at a given index
- Remove elements by **index** or **value**
- Find a value in the list
- Get the total **length** of the list
- Print the list in a readable format
- Populate the linked list with values from a list

## Why Linked Lists?
Linked Lists are an essential data structure that:
- Allow dynamic memory allocation
- Provide efficient insertions and deletions compared to arrays
- Form the foundation for more complex data structures (Stacks, Queues, Graphs)

## File Structure
ðŸ“‚ Day30_LinkedList â”‚â”€â”€ node.py # Defines the Node class â”‚â”€â”€ linked_list.py # Implements the LinkedList class â”‚â”€â”€ test_linked_list.py # Unit tests for LinkedList â”‚â”€â”€ README.md # Project documentation

Learning Outcomes
By implementing this Linked List, I practiced:
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
    Memory management (dynamic allocation of nodes)
    Algorithmic thinking for efficient data handling
    Writing unit tests to validate functionality
