# Day 35 â€“ Student Pass Predictor ðŸŽ“

This is my Day 35 project in the 100 Days of Code (Python) challenge â€” and also my **first machine learning project**!

The project is a command-line tool that uses user-provided student data (like gender, parental education, and exam scores) to **predict whether a student will pass or fail**.

I trained the model using the `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn, along with a custom preprocessing pipeline that handles categorical and numerical features.

This was a great hands-on introduction to model training, evaluation, and deployment in a real-world-like CLI app.

##  How to Run the Project

python main.py


### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seemachavesta/100-days-of-code-python.git
