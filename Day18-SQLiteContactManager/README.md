Contact Database Manager
This is a simple Python project that demonstrates basic database operations using SQLite. It is part of my 100-day Python code challenge (Day 18). In this project, I explored how to interact with a database to manage contacts. The functionalities implemented include:

Creating a table in the SQLite database
Inserting new contacts into the database
Deleting contacts by name from the database
Displaying all contacts stored in the database

Features
Create Table: Creates a table for storing contact information (name, number, and email) if it doesn't already exist.
Insert Contact: Inserts new contacts or replaces existing contacts if a contact with the same name already exists.
Delete Contact: Allows deleting contacts from the database by their name.
Display Contacts: Fetches and displays all the contacts currently stored in the database.
