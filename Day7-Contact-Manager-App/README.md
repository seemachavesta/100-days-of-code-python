The Contact Management System is a Python program created to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The program includes two main classes: Contact and ContactManager. The Contact class represents an individual contact, with attributes such as name, phone number, email, and address. 
The ContactManager class is responsible for managing the contacts, including adding new ones, removing existing contacts, and viewing all contacts. The program provides a user-friendly, interactive menu for users to perform operations like adding, removing, or viewing contacts. It was developed to enhance Python programming skills, with a focus on object-oriented design, handling user input, and creating interactive command-line applications. Future improvements could include adding search functionality, the ability to edit contacts, and persistent storage by saving and loading contacts from a file.
