100-days-of-code-python

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Python through a 100-day code challenge. Although it's called "100 Days of Code," I progress on a weekly basis, as Iâ€™m also pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and working on various school projects and assignments.

ðŸ“š Learning Philosophy

Each week, I focus on building meaningful projects and practice exercises that not only help me apply new concepts but also reinforce previously learned ones. Instead of creating a new project every day, I integrate new knowledge into existing or expanded projectsâ€”making my learning deeper and more practical.

ðŸ”€ Branch Structure

master branch: Contains my primary and complete projects.

restore-branch2 branch: Used for intermediate versions, experimentation, or restoring work during development.

ðŸ§  Topics Covered So Far

File handling

Databases using SQLite

Logging in Python

Linked Lists

Iterators and higher-order functions

CSV and JSON file operations

CLI-based applications

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This challenge is not just about consistency but about building real-world skills, one project at a time.
