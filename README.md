Day 1: Prime or Composite Number Checker

This Python program is designed to help users determine whether a given number is prime or composite. The program prompts the user to input a positive integer greater than 1. It then checks if the number is divisible by any other number, excluding 1 and itself, to classify it as prime or composite. If a divisor is found, the program prints the number's factors and labels it as "Composite." If no divisors are found, the number is labeled as "Prime." After each check, the user is asked if they would like to continue. If 'y' is entered, the program will allow another check; any other input will exit the program. The code uses a for loop to check divisibility up to the square root of the input number, making the process more efficient. Future enhancements could include more robust input validation and optimizations for handling larger numbers. This project is part of my 100-day coding challenge and serves as a starting point for improving my Python skills.
