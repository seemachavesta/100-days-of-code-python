Contact Manager
A simple Python-based contact management application that allows users to store, view, search, add, and delete contacts from a CSV file. The app provides basic contact management functionality and can be easily extended for additional features.

Features
Add Contact: Add a new contact with name, phone number, and email.
View Contacts: List all saved contacts.
Search Contact: Search for a contact by name.
Delete Contact: Delete a contact by name.
No Duplicate Contacts: Ensures no duplicate contacts are added.
Learning Objectives
This project was built as part of my 100 Days Python Code Challenge (Day 17). During this project, I learned how to use the csv module in Python, specifically:

csv.reader(): To read data from a CSV file and load it into the application.
csv.writer(): To write data (new contacts or updates) to a CSV file.
