Expense Manager

This project is part of my 100 Days of Python Code Challenge (Day 29). The Expense Manager is a Python application that analyzes expenses from a CSV file and provides various expense-related calculations and summaries.

Features

Reads expense data from a CSV file (expense.csv).

Calculates:

Total expenses

Average expense

Maximum expense

Minimum expense

Categorizes expenses and provides a summary by category.

Saves the expense summary to a new CSV file (expense_summary.csv).

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Unittest (for testing)

Notes

Ensure the expense.csv file exists in the project directory.

The script handles missing files gracefully and initializes with empty data.

Day 29 Progress

Implemented expense calculations.

Used Pandas for data processing.

Added unit tests for validation.

Practiced file handling and error management.

Learned how to use Pandas for reading, processing, and writing CSV files.

Gained experience with unittest to write and run test cases, ensuring the correctness of the application.
