# ðŸŽ“ School Admin Panel - Day 34 of 100 Days of Python

Welcome to **Day 34** of my **100 Days of Python** challenge!  
This project is a command-line based **School Administration Panel** with **role-based access control**, developed using core Python principles like decorators, class-based design, and dynamic user input handling.
