Day 2: Vowel Checker
This Python program helps users determine how many vowels are in a given word or sentence.

The purpose of this program is to practice using for loops, while loops, and sets in Python.

While writing this program, I learned that searching in sets is faster than in tuples and arrays. This is because arrays (or lists) use a linear search (O(n)), while sets leverage hash-based search (O(1)), making them significantly faster for lookups.
