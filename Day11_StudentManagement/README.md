Student Management System: Day 11

This program is written in Python.

The program allows the user to:

Add students
Update grades
Display the student list
Count the total number of students
Calculate the average grade

Through this project, I practiced object-oriented programming in Python, as well as the use of @classmethod and @property decorators.
