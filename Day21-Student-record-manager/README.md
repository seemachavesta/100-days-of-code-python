Student Record Manager Application

Overview

The Student Record Manager Application is a Python program that helps manage student data, including their subjects and grades. It demonstrates the use of Python's filter built-in function and practices good programming principles such as modular design and JSON-based file handling.

This project was created as part of the 100-day Python code challenge (Day 21).

Features

4. Delete Students

Remove a student record by their ID.

5. Persistent Storage

Student data is saved to a JSON file (students.json) and automatically loaded on startup.


Key Concepts Practiced

File Handling: Reading and writing JSON files.

filter Function: Filtering data based on specific conditions.

Object-Oriented Programming: Using classes to structure the program.
