Day 3 Code
This program is written in Python.

The objective of this project was to practice list comprehension, dictionary comprehension, and the zip() function.

The program performs the following tasks:

Creates two lists: one with student names and another with their corresponding scores.
Uses the zip() function to combine these two lists into a dictionary where student names are keys and their scores are values.
Modifies the scores by adding a bonus of 5 points, ensuring that no score exceeds 100.
Assigns grades to students based on their modified scores.
Calculates the average score of all students.
Filters and lists the students who have scores below the average.
Key Concepts Practiced:
List comprehension
Dictionary comprehension
zip() function
Conditional statements (for grading and filtering)
