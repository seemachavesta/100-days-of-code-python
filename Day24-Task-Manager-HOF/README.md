TaskManagerHOF

TaskManagerHOF is Python project I developed as part of my 100-day Python code challenge. The primary goal of this project was to practice creating custom higher-order functions and improve my skills in unit testing. This project represents Day 24 of my journey and is tailored for learning purposes, focusing on hands-on practice with functional programming concepts and testing methodologies.

Features

Create Tasks: Add new tasks with attributes like name, priority, due date, and status.

Display Tasks: View all tasks in a well-formatted table.

Apply Functions to Tasks: Use custom higher-order functions to modify tasks dynamically.

Filter Tasks: Retrieve tasks based on specific conditions.

Summarize Tasks: Generate summaries of pending and completed tasks.

Update Task Status: Change the status of a task (e.g., mark as completed).

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks by name.

Unit Testing: Comprehensive tests to validate the functionality of each method.

Learning Outcomes

Higher-Order Functions: Practiced creating and using functions that accept other functions as arguments, enhancing flexibility and modularity.

Unit Testing: Learned how to write unit tests using Python's unittest module to validate the correctness of my code.

JSON Handling: Gained experience in reading, writing, and updating JSON files to persist data.

Code Organization: Improved my ability to structure code into reusable, maintainable functions.

Error Handling: Implemented exception handling to manage file-related errors gracefully.

Reflections

This project was an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of higher-order functions and test-driven development. It challenged me to think about modularity and efficiency while keeping the focus on learning.
