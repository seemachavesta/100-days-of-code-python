Restaurant Management System

This project is a part of my  100-Day Python Code Challenge and represents the work completed on Day 22. It is a simple yet functional Restaurant Management System that allows users to manage a restaurant menu stored in a JSON file.

Features

Display Menu: View the entire restaurant menu with categories and item prices.

Add Item: Add a new item to a specific category in the menu.

Update Item Price: Update the price of an existing item in a category.

Delete Item: Remove an item from a specific category.

Discounted Menu: View items with prices greater than or equal to $10, applying a 10% discount.

Search Item: Search for a specific item within a category.

Place Order: Place an order by listing item names and receive a summary of available and unavailable items.

JSON Data Persistence: All menu data is stored and managed using a JSON file for simplicity and portability.

File Structure

main.py: Contains the user interface and handles user input.

menu_manager.py: Implements all the core functionality for menu management, including data loading, saving, and manipulation.

restaurant_menu.json: Stores the menu data in JSON format.
